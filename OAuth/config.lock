# OAuth Configuration Lock File
# Last Updated: October 24, 2025
# Status: âœ… WORKING AND TESTED

# This file locks the OAuth configuration to prevent breaking changes
# See IMPORTANT.md for complete documentation

OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE=iOS
IOS_CLIENT_ID=703601462595-qm6fnoqu40dqiqleejiiaean8v703639
BUNDLE_ID=com.messageapp.messaging

# Configuration:
# - App uses iosClientId with iOS OAuth client
# - Lambda uses SAME iOS client (has secret for token refresh)
# - Native iOS URL scheme redirect (no Expo auth proxy)
# - Both app and Lambda use identical client = token refresh works

# Why this works:
# - Bare workflow app needs native OAuth
# - iOS clients have secrets for server-side refresh
# - No dependency on Expo auth proxy (doesn't work for bare workflow)

# DO NOT CHANGE without reading IMPORTANT.md and testing thoroughly
