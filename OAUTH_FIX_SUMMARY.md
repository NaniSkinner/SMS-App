# ✅ OAuth Configuration - WORKING

## Status: FIXED AND TESTED ✅

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Result:** Calendar OAuth is now working correctly

---

## 🎯 The Working Configuration

**OAuth Client:** iOS Application  
**Client ID:** 703601462595-qm6fnoqu40dqiqleejiiaean8v703639.apps.googleusercontent.com  
**Used By:** Both iOS app and Lambda

## 🔑 Key Insights

### What We Learned

1. **This is a bare workflow app** - NOT Expo Go

   - Built with `npx expo run:ios`
   - Has native iOS code and URL schemes
   - Expo auth proxy doesn't work

2. **iOS clients DO have secrets**

   - Contrary to initial belief, iOS OAuth clients have client secrets
   - The secret is used by Lambda for server-side token refresh
   - Found in Google Cloud Console (download JSON or view details)

3. **Native OAuth is the right approach**
   - Bare workflow apps should use native OAuth
   - iOS URL scheme redirects work perfectly
   - Simpler and faster than Expo auth proxy
