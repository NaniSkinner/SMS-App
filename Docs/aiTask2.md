## 🧪 Testing Guide - Event Extraction (Task 2.1)

### Backend Testing (Lambda)

Run the automated test script to verify the Lambda endpoint:

```bash
cd tests
./test-event-extraction.sh
```

This tests 8 different message formats:

1. "Soccer practice Saturday 3pm" - Simple date and time
2. "Doctor appointment October 30th at 10:00 AM at Memorial Hospital" - Full details
3. "Team meeting tomorrow at 2pm for 1 hour" - Relative date
4. "Let's grab coffee next Monday around 9" - Casual format
5. "Birthday party Sunday November 3rd 2pm-5pm at the park" - Duration
6. "How are you doing today?" - No event (negative test)
7. "Dentist on 10/28 at 3:30pm" - Numeric date
8. "Conference call at 14:00 on Friday" - 24-hour format

**Expected Results:**

- Tests 1-5, 7-8: `hasEvent: true` with extracted details
- Test 6: `hasEvent: false`
- All events should have: title, date, time, duration, confidence (0-1)

### Simulator Testing (iOS)

**Setup:**

1. Connect Google Calendar in AI Chat screen
2. Have some existing events in your calendar

**Test Flow:**

1. Open any chat conversation
2. Send test message: "Soccer practice Saturday 3pm"
3. Long press the message bubble
4. Select "Analyze with AI 🤖" from action sheet
5. Wait 1-2 seconds for analysis

**Verify EventExtractionCard appears with:**

- ✅ Header: "Event Detected" with calendar icon
- ✅ Event title: "Soccer practice"
- ✅ Date formatted nicely (e.g., "Sat, Oct 26")
- ✅ Time formatted as 12-hour (e.g., "3:00 PM - 4:00 PM")
- ✅ Duration: "60 minutes"
- ✅ Confidence badge (High/Medium/Low with color)
- ✅ Close button (X) in top right

**If conflicts exist:**

- ✅ Orange warning banner: "X Conflict(s) Detected"
- ✅ Tap warning → ConflictModal opens
- ✅ Modal shows proposed event at top
- ✅ Modal lists conflicting events with overlap times
- ✅ Modal shows alternative time suggestions (💡)
- ✅ Can select alternative time (becomes highlighted)
- ✅ "Book Anyway" button (orange)
- ✅ "Book at [time]" button if alternative selected

**If no conflicts:**

- ✅ No warning banner
- ✅ Single "Add to Calendar" button (full width, blue)

**Add to Calendar Flow:**

1. Tap "Add to Calendar" (or "Book Anyway")
2. Verify loading spinner appears
3. Wait 2-3 seconds
4. Verify success: cards disappear, no error message
5. Open Google Calendar app or web
6. Verify event was created with correct details

**Error Handling:**

- If calendar not connected → graceful error message
- If OpenAI fails → retry logic (automatic)
- If event creation fails → error banner at top

### Test Messages for Various Formats

```
"Doctor appointment October 30th at 10:00 AM"
"Team meeting tomorrow at 2pm for 1 hour"
"Birthday party Sunday 2pm-5pm at the park"
"Dentist on 10/28 at 3:30pm"
"Conference call at 14:00 on Friday"
"Lunch with Sarah next Tuesday noon"
"Pickup kids from school at 3:15pm"
"Zoom call Wednesday 9am - 10am"
```

   - Displays extracted event details (title, date, time, duration, location)
   - Shows confidence badge (High/Medium/Low with color coding)
   - Conflict warning banner (orange) if calendar conflicts detected
   - Two action buttons: "Add to Calendar" or "View Conflicts" + "Add Anyway"

   - List of conflicting events with overlap minutes color-coded
   - Alternative time suggestions (selectable chips)
   - Actions: "Cancel", "Book Anyway", or "Book at [alternative time]"

**Integration:**

- Updated `app/chat/[id].tsx` to wire up event extraction flow
- Long-press message → "Analyze with AI" already working
- Handlers added for: `handleAddToCalendar`, `handleViewConflicts`, `handleDismissAnalysis`
- Add to Calendar uses AI chat to call `createCalendarEvent` tool

**Types Updated:**

- Enhanced `AIExtractedEvent` with proper fields
- Added `CalendarEvent` type for conflict display

### How to Test

**Backend (Lambda Endpoint):**

```bash
chmod +x test-event-extraction.sh
./test-event-extraction.sh
```

**Simulator:**

1. Run `npx expo start` and launch in iOS simulator
2. Open any chat conversation
3. Send: "Soccer practice Saturday 3pm"
4. Long-press the message → "Analyze with AI 🤖"
5. Verify EventExtractionCard appears with event details
6. If you have calendar events, conflicts will show
7. Tap "Add to Calendar" to create the event

### Files Modified/Created

**Created:**

- `components/chat/EventExtractionCard.tsx` (429 lines)
- `components/chat/ConflictModal.tsx` (540 lines)
- `tests/test-event-extraction.sh` (142 lines)
- `tests/README.md` - Testing documentation index

**Modified:**

- `types/index.ts` - Updated AI types
- `app/chat/[id].tsx` - Integrated components + handlers
- `Docs/aiTask2.md` - Updated with completion status + testing guide

### Known Issues & Solutions

**Issue: OAuth "Authorization Error" in Simulator**

- **Cause:** Safari cache in iOS Simulator stores previous Google account
- **Solution:** Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
- **Alternative:** Sign out of Google in Safari before connecting calendar
- **Note:** This only affects development/simulator, not production

**Issue: Token Expiration**

- **Cause:** OAuth tokens naturally expire after ~1 hour
- **Solution:** Reconnect calendar when needed (automatic refresh coming in future)
- **Script:** Run `bash scripts/delete-calendar-tokens.sh` to force fresh connection

### What's Next

**✅ Task 2.1 Complete - Ready for Task 2.2!**

Now ready for **Phase 2, Task 2.2** - Decision Summarization feature.

**Next Steps:**

1. Create Lambda `decisionSummary` handler
2. Build DecisionSummaryCard component
3. Add "Summarize Decisions" button to group chats
4. Test with real group conversations
